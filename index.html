	<h2 class="nocount">Class Information</h2>
	<p>
		CSE 132 introduces students to fundamental concepts in the basic operation of computers, from microprocessors to servers, and explores the universal similarities between all modern computing problems: how do we represent data? How do we communicate with other computers? How do processors "think"?
	</p>
	<p>
		We study inputs, outputs, and sensing; information representation; basic computer architecture and machine language; time-critical computation; intermachine communication; and protocol design.
	</p>
	<p>
		Students use both desktop systems and handheld (Arduino-compatible) microcontrollers to design and implement solutions to laboratory problems. They also participate in active-learning sessions where they work with professors and their peers to solve problems collaboratively.
	</p>
	<p>Prerequisite: CSE 131 or equivalent.</p>

	<p>
		Lectures are on Monday at 11:40am (in the WU tradition of 10 min past).  The lectures are held in Simon 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lab locations are in your schedule.
	</p>
	<p>
		Come to the lab for which you are registered, but we may move you to a different section (at the same time) to better handle the load.
	</p>

	<h2 class="nocount">Materials</h2>
	<p>
		The <a href="http://cse.wustl.edu/~roger/cse132/cc_v0_04.pdf">class textbook</a> is free.
	</p>
	<p>
		Assignments require a desktop computer (available in lab) and the purchase of a separate Arduino kit ($90). You will be able to buy a kit in studio and lab hours for the first two weeks of school.
