This week we turn things around and send data from the PC to the Arduino.

<!--
This week we learn **assembly**, the programming language that literally tells the computer what actions to perform. Though we learn **AVR**, the specific language used by microprocessors (and not your computer), these concepts are the same for all modern computers.

You may also learn why most people prefer higher-level languages, like C or Java. 

This is the first part of a two-part assembly assignment, meant to teach the basic operations available in assembly.
